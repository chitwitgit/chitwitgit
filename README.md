## Chit's profile 

I am a coder from Hong Kong that loves problem solving. I have some basic knowledge in neural networks and python libraries such as numpy and pandas. 

```python
sentences=[
	'chit',
	'wit',
	'git'
]
print('My github username comes from')
for i in sentences:
	if i[0:2]=='ch':
		print(f'{i}: my given name')
	if i[0]=='w':
		print(f'{i}: my surname\'s first letter is w, I am a witty boy and wit ends with \'it\' , same as \'chit\' and \'git\'')
	if i[0]=='g':
		print(f'{i}: this one is self explanatory. it ends with \'it\'')
```
